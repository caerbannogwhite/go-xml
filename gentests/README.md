# Tests for generated code

This directory contains generated tests that ensure code
generated by the xsdgen package can marshal and unmarshal
documents described by an XML schema.

# Updating tests

To update the tests here, run

	go generate

Tests should be re-generated any time code generation behavior
is changed.

# Adding a new test

Adding a new test (and making it pass) is a great way to ensure
your use case continues to work. Create a new subdirectory
with the following:

* An XML schema file with the extension `.xsd`
* A sample XML document that conforms to the schema with
  extension `.xml`

If possible, use a small schema, or trim down an existing schema.
